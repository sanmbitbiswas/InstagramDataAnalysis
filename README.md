# InstagramDataAnalysis
This project is on the analysis of Instagram Account data that was taken from Kaggle. 
Relevant visualizations were created to point to some of the non-contributors of post success.
The data was analyzed to find the most relevant factors that contribute to impressions of a post. 
Once the factors were identified, a prediction model was trained to predict the success of a post.
